 Orthodox lectionary
-----------------------------------
This is a simple Python web scraper I made using beautiful soup to quickly access the daily readings from this website https://www.holytrinityorthodox.com/calendar/index.php. 
I plan to eventually move the thing to be entirely offline and include various features such as the lives of the saints.

To run:
'python orthocalendar.py'

To set up an alias I added the setup.sh script, this detects the directory the script is placed in and echoes an alias into your bash rc to run it.
