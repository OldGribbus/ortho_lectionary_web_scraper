 Orthodox lectionary
-----------------------------------
Simple Python web scraper I made using beautiful soup to quickly get the daily readings from https://www.holytrinityorthodox.com/calendar/index.php in the command line.

To run:
'python orthocalendar.py' in the directory where the script lives. 

The setup.sh script echoes an alias called 'dailyreadings' into the user's bash rc for quick access, it is not required if you know what you're doing.
